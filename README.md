sampleinterface
===============

a sample front end interface engine. I'm working on a project where are building a interface to work with a restful backend. So I decide don't use any frameworks to help me with the interface, but build something sample and useful to do json requests, populate and show for user.
This is, too, a little exercise for me, I'm learning so much about how to work with and build interfaces.
This, like is now, dont is recommended to use on a project, but I will develop so much and make it general useful.

My next step is make it jquery-free. Is my fight, make it sample and javascript only.
